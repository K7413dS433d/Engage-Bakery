# Engage Bakery â€“ Just another Engage Theme Demos site

## Overview

Engage Bakery is a simple static website developed as part of my first project with Route Company. It showcases a clean design using HTML and CSS, with minimal JavaScript utilized solely for the navigation bar. The project highlights fundamental web development skills and provides a foundation for future, more complex projects.

## Technology Used

- **HTML**: Structure and content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the website.
- **JavaScript**: Enhancements for the navigation bar.
